excerpt: 'X-ray microspectroscopic techniques are essential for studying morphological and chemical changes in materials, providing high-resolution structural and spectroscopic information. However, its practical data analysis for reliably retrieving the chemical states remains a major obstacle to accelerating the fundamental understanding of materials in many research fields. In this work, we propose a novel data formulation model for X-ray microspectroscopy and develop a dedicated unmixing framework to solve this problem, which is robust to noise and spectral variability. Moreover, this framework is not limited to the analysis of two-state material chemistry, making it an effective alternative to conventional and widely-used methods. In addition, an alternative directional multiplier method with provable convergence is applied to obtain the solution efficiently. Our framework can accurately identify and characterize chemical states in complex and heterogeneous samples, even under challenging conditions such as low signal-to-noise ratios and overlapping spectral features. Extensive experimental results on simulated and real datasets demonstrate its effectiveness and reliability.'
