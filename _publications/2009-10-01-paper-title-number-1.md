title: "Robust retrieval of material chemical states in X-ray microspectroscopy(Preprint)"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2009-10-01-paper-title-number-1
excerpt: 'We propose a novel data formulation model for X-ray microspectroscopy and develop a dedicated unmixing framework to solve this problem, which is robust to noise and spectral variability. Moreover, this framework is not limited to the analysis of two-state material chemistry, making it an effective alternative to conventional and widely-used methods. In addition, an alternative directional multiplier method with provable convergence is applied to obtain the solution efficiently.'
