title: "Improving Contrastive Learning on Imbalanced Seed Data via Open-World Sampling"
excerpt: "The data sampled from open-world always show a long tail distribution, further hurting the balancedness of contrastive learning. This paper proposed a unified sampling framework called MAK. It 
significantly boosts the balancedness and accuracy of contrastive learning via strategically sampling additional data. <br/>"
